<p> "Lambda Phi Epsilon was founded on February 25, 1981 by a group of nineteen
dedicated men led by principal founder Master Craig Ishigo. Thoe goal of the founders
was to transcend the limitations faced by traditional Asian American interest
organizations on campus. While these organizations were oftensplit along ines of 
national origins, the founders sought an establishment that drew its membership equally
from the different segments of the Asian American community. Their vision was that the 
members would eventually become the leaders of their respective ethnic communities, and thus, 
bridge the gaps fragmenting the Asian American community through their affiliation with a common 
organization. Today, Lambda Phi Epsilon stands as the LARGEST and GREATEST Asian-interest fratnerity
in the world."
